# Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) Investment Report

## 1. Summary
Sell / Underperform. Zscaler is a category leader with strong demand signals, but valuation remains elevated versus peers while GAAP operating losses persist and growth is decelerating; upside appears fully priced.
Contrarian angle: consensus focuses on durable Zero Trust tailwinds, but the stock’s EV/EBITDA and EV/FCF multiples price in a faster margin inflection than current GAAP trends support.

## 2. Simple overview
Zscaler sells cloud security that keeps employees and devices safe when they use the internet or connect to company apps. Instead of old hardware boxes, it routes traffic through a secure cloud that checks everything before it connects.

## 3. Overview of company
**Industry and TAM:** Zscaler operates in cloud security, specifically Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)/Security Service Edge (SSE). Dell’Oro estimates the SASE market reaches about $16B by 2028, while Gartner forecasts global security spending of ~$215B in 2024 growing ~14% YoY, providing a large and expanding spend pool. [1][2]

**Value proposition:** The Zero Trust Exchange platform replaces appliance-centric network security with cloud-delivered security and access, reducing complexity and improving security posture for distributed workforces. Zscaler’s platform emphasizes Zero Trust access for users, apps, and workloads, with policy enforcement and data protection delivered in the cloud. [3]

**Primary competitors and differentiation:** Zscaler’s closest public comparables are Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT), with private competitors including Netskope and large platform players (e.g., Microsoft) in SSE/SASE adjacency. Zscaler differentiates via its cloud-native Zero Trust Exchange architecture, large global cloud footprint, and a high mix of recurring subscription & support revenue (98% of FY2025 revenue). [3][4]

**Top 3 opportunities:**
1. **SASE/SSE market growth:** Continued enterprise migration to cloud-delivered security and Zero Trust architectures. [1][2]
2. **Platform expansion:** Cross-sell of adjacent products (ZPA, ZIA, ZDX, ZSCALER DSPM, etc.) to increase wallet share per customer. [3]
3. **AI-driven security:** Monetization of AI-driven capabilities to defend against AI-enabled threats and improve security operations outcomes. [5]

**Top 3 challenges:**
1. **Valuation risk:** Premium EV/EBITDA and EV/FCF multiples versus peers increase downside if growth slows. [6][7][8]
2. **Competitive pressure:** Large incumbents with broad security portfolios can bundle and discount. [3]
3. **GAAP profitability:** Zscaler remains GAAP operating loss-making; operating leverage must materialize to justify valuation. [9]

## 6. Management team and investors
Zscaler is founder-led by CEO Jay Chaudhry, with a long-tenured technical leadership bench. Compared with PANW and FTNT, Zscaler’s team is more singularly focused on cloud-native Zero Trust, though the peers have broader platform footprints. Recent executive additions include a new Chief Marketing Officer (Sunil Frida, ex-CrowdStrike) and an EVP of Agentic AI Security Engineering (Dr. Swamy Kocherlakota). [10]

Capital markets: Zscaler issued $1.2B of 0.125% convertible senior notes due 2028 (with a capped call) in FY2025, indicating continued access to low-cost capital. [9]

## 8. Recent developments (last 180 days)
1. **FY2025 results and FY2026 outlook:** Zscaler reported FY2025 results and issued FY2026 revenue guidance of $3.265B–$3.284B. [9]
2. **Q1 FY2026 results:** Zscaler reported Q1 FY2026 results with continued revenue growth and ARR expansion. [14]

5. **M&A:** Zscaler announced acquisition of SquareX to strengthen browser security. [16]

## 9. Price catalyst
**Top 3 potential price catalysts (12 months):**
1. **Upside:** Faster ARR growth or larger platform expansion (cross-sell) could drive revenue acceleration beyond FY2026 guidance. [9][14]
2. **Downside:** Budget tightening in IT/security or increased competitive discounting could pressure growth and billings. [3]
3. **Upside:** Evidence of operating leverage (GAAP profitability inflection) could expand multiple tolerance. [3]

**Most likely acquirer:** Cisco. Rationale: Cisco needs to accelerate its cloud-delivered Zero Trust/SASE stack; Zscaler would provide a leading SSE platform and recurring revenue base. Likelihood: ~10–15% given Zscaler’s valuation and potential antitrust scrutiny.
